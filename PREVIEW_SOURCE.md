# Playtest source and project context

Read [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) for the current implementation, roadmap, evidence and known differences between GitHub and the private playtest. Update it in every change commit, following [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

- Repository: https://github.com/DESIR33/My-City-My-Choices
- Private playtest: https://my-city-choices-play.jvazquez2022.chatgpt.site
- Audited repository baseline: `9bd9dc2d87270f7f265fdfe7ea43542c36508bc1`, through merged PR #75. Before editing, private Site version 77/source `3a164e3245b4648b99529669ea9ef7542ce002a7` matched all 287 runtime files.
- Current candidate addresses the persistent mobile coastal report with bounded character draw/animation/GPU residency, a shorter mobile horizon and distant hotel interior gating. Local Crash report works before 3D startup and preserves bounded prior-run technical evidence. v77 authored cars and save guards remain; no physical crash-resolution claim. Open #70 stays separate. Exact source/deployment/PR outcomes belong in the handoff.
- GitHub serves root `index.html` / `assets/`; the separate hosted source uses `dist/index.html` / `dist/assets/`.
- Both candidate runtime layouts contain 288 shipped files, including original binary models and compressed textures. Native story/geometry/asset tests and isolated phone-width objective/touch checks do not establish rendered GPU appearance or physical-device performance. This QA browser cannot initialize WebGL. The standalone setup explains that graphics failure; no fresh rendered full-game success is claimed.
- Run `npm run check:parity -- /absolute/path/to/site-checkout` to compare the complete runtime inventory and hashes, including binary assets. It is read-only and does not copy, authenticate or deploy. Non-runtime docs/tests differ intentionally. Full game CI runs native regressions and checker unit cases, not a private-Site comparison.
- Documentation-only changes do not imply a new deployed game version. Use exact commit/archive/deployment evidence for future publication claims.

Earlier navigation/courier validation notes described a historical snapshot. Current gameplay and verification limits are maintained in the context document.
